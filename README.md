# Nexloft [ IoT x Automated Smart Home ]

## Abstract
Smart Home Automation with Arduino and ESP32

This project presents a comprehensive smart home system that integrates Arduino Uno and ESP32 microcontrollers to enhance safety, convenience, and energy efficiency.

## Arduino Uno Features:
-Automated Water Tank Refill: Prevents overflow and ensures efficient water management.

-Fire and Smoke Detection: Activates an alarm system in case of fire hazards to ensure household safety.

-Environmental Monitoring: Measures humidity and temperature to maintain a comfortable living environment.

-Smart Lighting: Controls light-dependent evening lights around the house, along with a motion-sensor light for the bathroom, maximizing energy 
 efficiency.
 
## ESP32 Features:

-Remote Control: Allows for seamless operation of lights from anywhere in the world via a mobile app.

-Remote Door Access: Provides a secure method for controlling entry to your home.

The system utilizes a serial connection between the ESP32 and Arduino Uno, enabling the transmission of sensor data, including humidity, temperature, fire hazard status, and water levels. This data exchange is facilitated through Blynk Cloud and the Blynk mobile app, ensuring effective monitoring and control.

This project aims to share insights and methodologies for creating a smart home system, making it accessible for others interested in exploring similar IoT applications.
